## Setting Up Your Trezor
1. **Connect Your Trezor Device**: Use the provided USB cable to connect your Trezor device to your computer.
2. **Visit Trezor.io/Start**: Open your web browser and go to [Trezor.io/Start](https://trezor.io/start). This page will guide you through the setup process.
3. **Install Trezor Bridge**: Follow the instructions to download and install Trezor Bridge, the software that allows your computer to communicate with the Trezor device.

## Creating a New Wallet
